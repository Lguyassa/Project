Term Project on creating spatial database design for Philadelphia City Facilities

By: Lamessa K Guyassa
**Introduction** 

The role of geographic information systems (GIS) in urban planning and management has become increasingly crucial. The term project focuses on creating a spatial database design for the City of Philadelphia Facilities. It encompasses a broad spectrum of structures and fixed assets under the ownership, lease, or operation of the City of Philadelphia. This encompassing category includes administrative buildings, parks, fire stations, libraries, and various other facilities. Commonly referred to as the Master Facilities Database, this repository typically comprises comprehensive lists of buildings and fixed assets managed by the city. It spans across government offices, public facilities, and infrastructure. Importantly, it delineates sites that have received funding from the Capital Program to sustain or enhance the use of these facilities. This database is integral to urban management, acting as a linchpin in decision-making processes related to maintenance, strategic planning, and the allocation of resources. 

Far from being a static inventory, the City Facilities database emerges as a dynamic tool crucial for effective city governance. It goes beyond being a mere compilation of assets; instead, it serves as a dynamic and responsive resource. Its multifaceted role facilitates the tracking and management of diverse assets, empowering the city to make well-informed decisions pertaining to the upkeep, strategic planning, and utilization of its properties and infrastructure. The database emerges as an indispensable asset, essential for steering urban management practices in a direction that ensures both efficiency and efficacy. It underlines the interconnectedness of data-driven decision-making with the successful administration of urban resources. 

These Facilities include, but are not limited to: - administrative or multi-purpose buildings, athletic fields, airfields and airport buildings, bridges, ball courts, fire stations, health centers, libraries, museums, plazas, parks and park buildings, playground equipment, piers, Police stations, pools, recreation centers and buildings, radio towers, Water and wastewater facilities Metadata Catalog | phila.gov 

**Project Objectives** 

The primary goal of the project is to work with the Philadelphia City Facilities database, sourced from OpenDataPhilly, covering the years 2000 to 2016. The objectives include: 


**Normalization Plan:** Develop a normalization plan to organize the data efficiently for the Philadelphia City Facilities database. Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. In this context, it involves structuring the data to eliminate duplication and ensure efficient storage and retrieval of information. 

**Normalization Scripts:** This step aims to reduce data redundancy and enhance data integrity. Creating scripts for its implementation. These scripts will be used to transform the existing data into the normalized format. This step may involve restructuring tables, defining relationships between tables, and ensuring data consistency. 

 

**Data Analysis and Optimization:** Perform a comprehensive analysis of the database, optimizing its structure for improved performance. This involves database optimization techniques to enhance data retrieval and query performance, specifically focusing on the 2000 to 2016 time. 

**Data Sources and Catalogs** 

The primary data sources for this project are the City Facilities Dataset in .CSV or SHP format from OpenDataPhilly. Additionally, the City Facilities Data Dictionary from the Metadata Catalog provided by phila.gov is indispensable for understanding the attributes and structure of the data. This metadata is created by the Philadelphia Cityâ€™s Office of Information Technology, providing critical insights into the dataset. 

Integration of Census Tracts: The Census_Tract.shp or is identified as a valuable resource for understanding the spatial relationships between city facilities and the geographic characteristics of different areas within Philadelphia. This integration supports evidence-based decision-making and enhances the overall robustness of the analysis. 

**Potential Questions and Analytical query goals** 

1. What are the top 10 most recent revision details, including asset names, revision notes and edit dates for assets with revision notes created on or after January 1, 2015? 

This query retrieves information about the most recent revisions for assets, including the asset name, revision note, edit date, and editor, for assets with revision notes created on or after January 1, 2015. The results are sorted in descending order based on the edit date, and only the top 10 records are returned. 

2, To calculate the distance between two assets in the asset table. The goal is to find the pair of assets with the minimum spatial distance. 

The query aims to address the problem of finding the two assets with the smallest spatial distance between geographical points (assets in this case). 

3. How many assets are currently occupied within each subgroup, categorized by asset subgroup? 

This query is counting the number of assets that are currently in use (occupied) and grouping them based on their categories (subgroups). 

**Data Structure and Normalization Process** 
The ERD involve creating tables, inserting data, and establishing relationships between the tables.  The structure of the data and the normalization process are based on the information provided. The provided SQL script outlines the creation of several tables (opa, site, revision, asset_subtype, asset_subgroup, asset, and bldg) along with the insertion of data into these tables. Below is a summary of the structure and relationships among these tables:

opa Table:

Primary Key: opa_id
Columns: opa_id, opa_owner, opa_address
site Table:

Primary Key: site_name
Columns: site_code, site_acres, primary_site, secondary_site, site_name
revision Table:

Primary Key: note
Columns: note, edit_date, edit_source, editor
asset_subtype Table:

Primary Key: subtype
Columns: subtype, description
asset_subgroup Table:

Primary Key: subgroup
Columns: subgroup, description
asset Table:

Primary Key: gid
Foreign Keys: note (References revision), opa_id (References opa), subtype (References asset_subtype), site_name (References site), subgroup (References asset_subgroup)
Columns: gid, asset_id, asset_name, asset_type, asset_address, status, geom, city_owned, not_public, cityown_desc, serving_type, occupant, opa_id, site_name, subgroup, subtype, note
bldg Table:

Primary Key: bldg_id
Foreign Key: asset_id (References asset)
Columns: bldg_id, sharebldg, asset_id
Normalization Process:

Normalization involves organizing data to eliminate redundancy and dependency issues.
The script creates separate tables for different entities such as opa, site, revision, asset_subtype, asset_subgroup, asset, and bldg.
Each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records, and foreign keys establish relationships between tables.

ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):

![ERD_Project_final](https://github.com/Lguyassa/Project/assets/89851403/713fb6de-b109-4dc6-99ec-b2a00125d1e4)

Figure.1.2     ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) 

This ERD illustrates the relationships between different tables, including primary and foreign keys. Arrows indicate the direction of the relationship, and cardinality notation represents how many records in one table relate to another. 

 The normalization process aims to reduce data redundancy, improve data integrity, and make the database more efficient.

**Normalization Process:** 
Primary Keys: 
Each table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each record. Primary keys are used to establish relationships between tables. 
Foreign Keys: 
Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between the asset table and lookup tables (opa, site, note, asset_subtype, asset_subgroup). 

Lookup Tables: 
Lookup tables (opa, site, revision, asset_subtype, asset_subgroup) help maintain data integrity and avoid data duplication by storing unique values that are referenced by other tables. 

 
Query 1: Top 10 Most Recent Revision Details 

Question: What are the top 10 most recent revision details, including asset names, revision notes, and edit dates for assets with revision notes created on or after January 1, 2015? 

Optimized Query: 

    SELECT asset.asset_name, revision.note, revision.edit_date, revision.editor 
    FROM asset 
    JOIN revision ON asset.note = revision.note 
    WHERE revision.edit_date >= '2015-01-01' 
    ORDER BY revision.edit_date DESC 
    LIMIT 10; 
     

Explanation: 

The query uses a JOIN operation to connect the asset and revision tables based on the common column `asset.revision_note = revision.note.` 

The WHERE clause filters the results to include only revisions created on or after January 1, 2015 `(revision.edit_date >= '2015-01-01')`. 

The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in descending order based on the edit date `(revision.edit_date DESC)`, ensuring that the most recent revisions appear first. 

The LIMIT clause restricts the output to the top 10 records, improving query efficiency. 

Potential Optimization: 

Creating indexes on `asset.note and revision.edit_date` can enhance the performance of the query, especially when dealing with large datasets. 



    CREATE INDEX idx_asset_note ON asset (revision_note); 
    CREATE INDEX idx_revision_edit_date ON revision (edit_date); 

 

Query 2: Calculate Distance Between Two Assets 

Question: To calculate the distance between two assets in the asset table, find the pair of assets with the minimum spatial distance. 

Optimized Query: 

    SELECT a1.asset_name AS asset1_name, a2.asset_name AS asset2_name, ST_Distance(a1.geom, a2.geom) AS distance_in_meters 
    FROM asset a1 
    JOIN asset a2 ON a1.gid <> a2.gid 
    ORDER BY distance_in_meters 
    LIMIT 1; 

 

Explanation: 

The query performs a self-join on the asset table `(a1 joined with a2)` to compare different assets. 

The WHERE clause `(a1.gid <> a2.gid)` ensures that assets are not compared to themselves. 

The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set by the calculated distance in ascending order. 

The LIMIT clause restricts the result set to only return the first row, representing the pair of assets with the minimum distance. 

Potential Optimization: 
Creating a spatial index on the `geom` column can significantly speed up spatial search operations. 
`CREATE INDEX idx_asset_geom ON asset USING GIST(geom); 
 

Query 3: Count Occupied Assets by Subgroup 
Question: How many assets are currently occupied within each subgroup, categorized by asset subgroup? 

Optimized Query: 

    SELECT asg.subgroup, COUNT(*) AS occupied_assets 
    FROM asset a 
    JOIN asset_subgroup asg ON a.subgroup = asg.subgroup 
    WHERE a.occupant IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY asg.subgroup;

Explanation: 

The query joins the asset table with the `asset_subgroup` table based on the common column `asset.asset_subgroup = asset_subgroup.subgroup.` 

The WHERE clause filters records to include only those where the occupant column in the a`sset table is not NULL (a.occupant IS NOT NULL).` 

The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the subgroup column from the `asset_subgroup` table. 

Potential Optimization: 

Creating indexes on `asset.asset_subgroup and asset.occupant` can enhance the efficiency of the JOIN and WHERE operations. 


    CREATE INDEX idx_asset_subgroup ON asset (asset_subgroup); 
    CREATE INDEX idx_occupant ON asset (occupant); 
    CREATE INDEX idx_subgroup ON asset_subgroup (subgroup); 

These optimizations aim to improve the performance of the queries by creating indexes on relevant columns and supporting efficient data retrieval and filtering.
